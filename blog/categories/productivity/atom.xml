    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every year at the end of December I tend to think a lot about how the previous 12 months
went and think up some goals for the coming year. Some may snort derisively at this, as
effectively I&rsquo;m making a bunch of New Year&rsquo;s resolutions and for people as a whole resolutions
don&rsquo;t seem to actually work. Personally I find the Christmas/New Year period ideal for thinking
about what I want to improve about myself, I always take time off work so it&rsquo;s ideal for
deciding upon some fresh goals.</p>

<p>Now of course it is February 2017, so as well as telling you about my goals I&rsquo;ll also discuss the
progress I made on them in January!</p>

<h2>1. Achieve a body weight of 110kg</h2>

<p>I carried this goal over from 2016 as I didn&rsquo;t achieve it, that&rsquo;s not to say I made no progress
though. I started 2016 weighing 143.5kg and I ended it weighing 136kg for a total loss of 7.5kg.
Safe to say there were ups and downs, but I proved something significant in 2016, which is that
I was able to lose weight and for the most part keep it off, even if it wasn&rsquo;t the amount that
I wanted. In 2017 I want to repeat that success - and hopefully dramatically surpass it.</p>

<p>My approach to weight loss differs from the approach most people take, most people resolve to
eat less food and get more exercise in order to shed body weight. I also strive to do this, but
I start from a very different place - my mind.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve practiced mindfulness meditation on and off for a few years, I was first interested in it
when I found out about a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3191261/">study that showed training in mindfulness was more effective in helping
smokers quit than the American Lung Association&rsquo;s &ldquo;Freedom From Smoking&rdquo; treatment</a>.</p>

<p>It seemed a reasonable conclusion that if mindfulness could help with cigarette addiction it could
also help me train myself to eat less. I successfully employed mindfulness in the latter half of 2014
to help me achieve a 126kg body weight. I ended up gaining all of the weight back in 2015 as I felt
forced to change my priority to my sleep. With my sleep problems largely well managed, my focus on
weight loss resumed in 2016.</p>

<p>My approach is to meditate for 20 minutes every day combined with mindful eating of my evening meals.
Mindful eating is effectively meditation where you focus on the food you&rsquo;re eating rather than on
the breath, but it has other benefits beyond mindfulness practice. I find it useful for changing
the relationship I have with food. I&rsquo;ve picked up some bad habits where I mindlessly eat
while watching TV, barely paying attention to the weight I&rsquo;m piling on with every mouthful. Mindful
eating challenges that habit by having me pay close attention to every bite. It also encourages eating
meals slowly, which almost always results in me feeling satiated by the end of the meal.</p>

<p>My progress in January on this goal has been solid, I weigh 133.7kg, so I&rsquo;ve lost 2.3kg, hopefully
I can keep the pace up, but inevitably there will be stumbles where I gain a small amount back. The
key is resuming my routine quickly after I go off the rails.</p>

<h2>2. Achieve a resting heart rate below 60 beats per minute</h2>

<p>Cardiovascular health is probably the key health concern in my life at present, high blood pressure
runs in the family along with risks of heart disease and stroke. I hardly stack the deck in my favour
by carrying so much extra weight, but I can improve my health independently of my success in weight loss
through exercise. A reasonable measurement of cardiovascular fitness is resting heart rate, so I started
to measure it at the end of 2016 and the results were not good. It was showing a resting heart rate in
the 90s, at the high end of the normal range. So I resolved to start exercising to bring my resting heart
rate down.</p>

<p>I set a goal to get it below 80bpm. I achieved that goal about a week after starting to exercise, so I changed my goal again to 70bpm.
As of the end of January my resting heart rate for the last 5 days has been between 67-69bpm. Clearly I
didn&rsquo;t realise just how quick the response to exercise would be, I&rsquo;ve set a much more ambitious goal of
60bpm, we shall see if I have to move the goalposts yet again.</p>

<p>My routine is a fairly simple one, I modified my commute in order to force myself to walk more, by designing
movement into my every day life I walk at least 8000 steps on a workday. I still have active exercise sessions,
but I keep them short and intense, I alternate between interval training on a rowing machine on one day and
circuit training with bodyweight exercises like squats and press ups on the other. Thus far I&rsquo;ve found this
approach to be more sustainable than ones I&rsquo;ve attempted before. By acknowledging that I&rsquo;m not aiming to be
an athlete or a sportsman I&rsquo;m able to cut the amount of time I spend exercising but still get health benefits.</p>

<h2>3. Go to at least 3 music gigs</h2>

<p>I decided on this goal because I thought my life was a bit boring, I had my routine and I stuck to it, but
there&rsquo;s so much to do in London and I was missing out. I&rsquo;d always been put off going to gigs because I
wrongly assumed it would be a similar experience to going clubbing (I hate night clubs), it turns out I
really enjoy gigs, so this is my attempt to force myself to go to more.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got tickets booked for 2 gigs so far this year, Iron Maiden and Primus, so I&rsquo;m already most of the way
there to achieving this goal.</p>

    <updated>2017-01-28T23:57:10+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://steveparrington.github.io/blog/2017/01/28/what-i-did-to-fix-my-sleep</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>University for me will always be remembered as a lost opportunity. That&rsquo;s not to say
I didn&rsquo;t get a lot out of my time there, I learnt a lot of things - both about myself and
about Computer Science. But I&rsquo;m almost certain I was capable of more than I achieved and
that ultimately the thing that let me down the most was a catastrophic sleep schedule.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d go to bed at 4am because that was when I felt tired, I faced the choice of either forcing
myself out of bed to go to lectures while heavily sleep deprived, or missing out on the education that
I was paying for to catch up on sleep. I&rsquo;d eat at odd times of day, I consumed way too
much caffeine to counteract the effects of sleep deprivation which only made it worse in the long
term. I became depressed, my grades were terrible and so began 5 years of not being able to
remember when I was last happy.</p>

<p>I went to see doctors and I read books and scoured the internet for anything that I could do to
improve my situation. The problem was that the solutions felt like too much of an imposition and
in my depressed state I lacked the will to try them. Fast-forward 5 years, I&rsquo;m a software developer
working in London, I&rsquo;m doing ok but I&rsquo;m miserable, I contemplate suicide as a way out but thankfully
reject it. It became clear to me that if I was ever going to be happy again, I needed to fix my sleep.</p>

<p>Sleep as it turns out is essential for cognition. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1739867/">study from the University of New South Wales</a>
compared the effects of sleep deprivation to alcohol intoxication and found that 17-19 hours without
sleep was equivalent to a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.05%! I used a BAC calculator to
see how that mapped on to actual drinks and found I&rsquo;d have to drink 6 16oz beers over 3 hours
to match that level of sleep deprivation. There&rsquo;s a vast amount of evidence to support the idea
that we need enough sleep to function - as anyone who has suffered difficulties with their
sleep knows all too well.</p>

<p>A frustrating aspect of my struggle to get enough sleep was that people who had no sleep problems
at all would declare that I just needed to go to bed earlier and all would be well. I&rsquo;d liken this
to telling someone with depression to just cheer up, it&rsquo;s just not that simple. It turns out that
our bodies have a variety of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_clock">internal clocks</a> that coordinate our biology with the day-night cycle.
These are called circadian clocks - and the rhythms they control influence everything from our
core body temperature to the production of hormones to when we can fall asleep.</p>

<p>Clocks are never perfect, they&rsquo;re either a bit too fast or a bit too slow - because of this it&rsquo;s
important to be able to adjust them otherwise they gradually get out of sync with the rest of the
world. Our circadian clocks are no different, they&rsquo;re adjusted by external environmental factors
called &ldquo;zeitgebers&rdquo; (German for &ldquo;time-giver&rdquo;). These include light, temperature and even when we eat.</p>

<p>A lot of people know about the negative impact that screen use late at night has on our sleep,
this is because the light from the screen is making our body think it&rsquo;s still daytime and so the
biological conditions necessary for sleep are delayed. What a lot of people don&rsquo;t know is that some
people&rsquo;s sleep phase (the period of the day when they&rsquo;re most likely to sleep) is delayed significantly
by almost all artificial lighting. For these people - and I appear to be among them, the 21st century
is a place where we do not belong, we are maladapted for this environment. Fortunately for me, there was
no end of information on the topic online and I found very effective tools to take control of my circadian
rhythms. Unsurprisingly, this is done by manipulating the zeitgebers that affect our circadian clocks.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer: This is the stuff that worked for me, with my specific sleep problems. I sincerely hope
that you find these useful, but there&rsquo;s no guarantee. Also go and see your doctor, they can help.</strong></p>

<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_therapy">Dark Therapy</a></h2>

<p>This is by far the most extreme intervention I made - it is also the most effective and when combined
with bright light therapy (described below) it can fix my sleep schedule in about 3 days, without the
bright light therapy it can take as long as 2 weeks. It&rsquo;s an incredibly simple intervention, I lie in
almost total darkness for some period before sleep, the idea being that it will prevent the delaying of
my sleep phase. I used to need to do it for 90 minutes every evening -
a massive amount of my free time, but it proved to be worth the trade. If you&rsquo;re desperate enough to do
this (as I was) there are some things you should know.</p>

<ul>
<li>Doing this every evening consistently is very difficult to keep up, for me, failure is inevitable.
Don&rsquo;t aim for perfection, aim for better than where you are now.</li>
<li>Podcasts, audiobooks and music will keep you sane.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_therapy">Light Therapy</a></h2>

<p>Just as dark therapy is all about telling your body when it is night, light therapy is about
letting it know that morning has arrived. Essentially your eyes need to receive a lot of bright light
shortly after waking up. Standard indoor lighting will not do for this purpose - the cheapest way to
get the light you need is to go outside for a while after waking up (assuming the sun has risen).
If you&rsquo;re like me you&rsquo;ll find that this makes it a lot easier to get up in the morning - I normally
wake up before my alarm if I&rsquo;ve been doing it for a few days. This is because it advances the sleep
phase. As with the dark therapy, I have some tips.</p>

<ul>
<li>In the winter it can be difficult to get the required amount of light in the mornings, you can
make sure you get enough light by buying a SAD lamp, or if you don&rsquo;t want to have to sit in the
same place you can get a light visor (I have <a href="http://re-timer.com/">this one</a>) which means I can get my light while doing
my morning routine.</li>
<li>Try and do this as soon after waking up as possible, the advancing effect on the sleep phase diminishes
as the day progresses.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_therapy#Virtual_darkness">Blue Blocking Goggles</a></h2>

<p>For me this is a less effective version of dark therapy - but it allows you to have a mostly normal
evening. All this involves is wearing some goggles with lenses that filter out light towards the blue
end of the spectrum. Blue light has a much more pronounced delaying effect than the other parts of the
spectrum, this is the idea behind software like <a href="https://justgetflux.com/">f.lux</a>, it tints your screen to be orange, reducing the
amount of blue light you see.</p>

<p>Personally I&rsquo;ve found that I still experienced some delaying
of my sleep phase while using these, but they&rsquo;re better than no intervention at all.
My current goggles have orange lenses, meaning they filter out blue light and some green light, but
I recently read that the green part of the spectrum has a delaying effect as well. My next
experiment is to acquire some goggles that block out both blue and green (red lenses) and see how
effective they are. I&rsquo;ll try to follow up with another post on how it goes.</p>

<ul>
<li>Most goggles that are available do not look fashionable, they&rsquo;re pretty much lab goggles.
I recently found out about <a href="https://www.carbonshade.com/">carbonshade</a>, they sell blue and green blocking glasses that don&rsquo;t look
terrible - worthwhile if you&rsquo;re put off by wearing goggles.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Additional Things</h2>

<ul>
<li>Try to make your room as dark as possible, get a blackout curtain and cover up the charging lights
from your devices.</li>
<li>Try to regulate the temperature of your bedroom, 18 degrees celsius is a common recommendation.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t consume caffeine from late afternoon onwards.</li>
</ul>


<p>And that&rsquo;s pretty much everything I do to manage my sleep. The results have been remarkable, I&rsquo;ve
beaten my depression and I&rsquo;ve been mostly happy for quite some time. I&rsquo;ve been more productive at
work and I&rsquo;m enjoying my life far more. I hope you can gain some value from what I&rsquo;ve shared - and
if there are caffeine fueled students out there reading this at 4am, turn out the lights, put on
a podcast and go to bed.</p>
